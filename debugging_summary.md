### 3. Version Compatibility Issues
**Error:**

## Steps Taken So Far

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Created React application
   - Added dynamic components and UI elements

2. **Tailwind CSS Integration**
   - Installed required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss@3.3.3 postcss@8.4.29 autoprefixer@10.4.15
   ```
   - Created configuration files:
     - tailwind.config.js
     - postcss.config.js

3. **Configuration Files**
   - tailwind.config.js set to scan:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       content: [
         "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
         "./public/index.html"
       ],
       theme: {
         extend: {},
       },
       plugins: [],
     }
     ```
   - postcss.config.js configured with:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       plugins: {
         tailwindcss: {},
         autoprefixer: {},
       },
     }
     ```

4. **CSS Setup**
   - Modified index.css to include Tailwind directives
   - Added responsive design classes in components

## Current Status
- Tailwind CSS is properly installed with correct versions
- Configuration files are in place
- Application structure is set up with responsive components
- Development server should now recognize Tailwind classes

## Next Steps
1. Verify that Tailwind classes are being applied correctly
2. Test responsive design across different screen sizes
3. Check for any remaining styling issues
4. Consider adding custom theme values if needed
